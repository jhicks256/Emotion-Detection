# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection Project for Senior Seminar
This is my project for senior seminar at Earlham College. 
This program uses OpenCV software for object recognition.
The executable is located in modules/ and to run it: ./facedetect
The four cascade classifiers that I created are located in happy/ sad/ surprised/ and angry/.
